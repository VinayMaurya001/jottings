Python Execution Modes: 2 modes of Execution
	1)Interactive mode
		Interactive mode: 
			Here we directly type our python stmts on interpreter and can easily communicate line by line.
		    Advantage: For learning Python and to test the functionalities of python
	2)Batch mode
		Batch mode: Here we write set or batch of stmts within Editors/IDE's and save it by using
	            .py extension and later submit to python interpreter.
		

Various Editors
	1)Notepad
	2)Editplus
	3)vi 
	4)nano
	5)gedit

Various IDE's (Integrated Development Environment)
	1)IDLE
			whenever we install python, along with python
			we can IDLE(Integrated Development Learning Environment)----->
			where we can work with interactive mode as well as batch mode.
	2)PyCharm---------->mostly used
			https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows
	3)Eclipse(with PyDev plugin)
	4)PyDev
	5)VisualStudioCode
	6)Komodo
	7)Spyder
	8)Netbeans
	9)Jupyter Notebook
	10)Atom
			
	
Developing Python Applications using Editors
		ex: Notepad
		sample1.py
			x=10
			y=20
			print(x+y)
			print(x-y)
			print(x*y)
			print(x/y)
		submitting the file to interpreter------->
		goto cmdprompt---->python C:\python8ambatch\sample1.py
		It gives the ouput

Python was developed by Guido Van Rossum in 1989.

What is Python?
	Python is 
		interpreted, 
		functional and 
		object oriented 
		high level programming language.
		simple-syntax
		inbuilt libraries or modules

	Python is interpreted so it is very quick.There is no compilation step.
	And also it is both functional as well as it supports all the Object Oriented principles.
	It's very easy to learn Python because of its syntax and we can also Develop applications quickly because
	of its in-built modules or libraries.

why Python?
		Python is a
		          -General Purpose
		          			Pascal- Mathematical purpose 
		          			Fortran-Scienctific purpose
		          			COBOL- Business Purpose
		          -Multi Programming paradigm
								Python was built or derived by taking the features or advantages from various other programming languages such as
								1)Procedural Oriented PRogramming: ex :C-Language---------->Functions
								2)Object Oriented Programming      ex: C++,Java  ----------->Security,Re-usability,flexibility
								3)Scripting Languages              ex: shellscript--------->dynamic Datatypes
								4)Modular PRogramming              ex: modula-3  ---------->Modules--------->89300 modules         		
		          -High-level
		          			Low-level-Languages
		          					Assembly level
		          					No human understandable
		          					Not Portable-Machine depedent
		          -performance 
										interpreted  ??????????????????
		          			Compilation-Not line by line execution-debuging difficult
										the performance of the applications developed in Python is super good 
											because Python is a interpreted language. 
											There is no additional step of compilation.
		          -easy to learn & use
								Python is a user-friendly programming language which provides simple syntaxes which looks like normal english stmts.
								Python gives us a very easy to learn and use syntax making the life of a developer a super easy to build applications,
							-Rapid development
								We can quickly develop our applications because Python comes with a lot of inbuilt modules 
								that can be used to build our applications.
								We need not code everything from scratch.
								There is a lot module/packages available in Python itself.That can be used. 
							-Dynamically typed
								Just like javascript, Python is dynamically typed.
								That is we need not specify what datatype we are going to assign a variable depending on whatever data we assign.
								Python will dynamically decide what type of data that variable is carrying 
							-Large community
								For any open source framework or language,it is very important that it has a good following and Python has a huge community.
								So at any point if we have to work on something new in our application 
									and if we need some support from python then we have a huge community of developer to rely on.
							-third party libraries.
								This is where Python is called batteries included 
								because Python can easily integrate with any third party library for example.
									cherryPy  is object oriented http framework.
									Similarly Boto is a library that can be used to work with Amazon Web Services while working with python applications.

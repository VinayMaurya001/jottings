	React- Facebook

Some problems with JavaScript
1)Weak type checking
		function add(num1,num2){
			return num1+num2;}
		console.log(add('2'+'3'));//23 , although in JavaScript itself we have mitigation strategies to avoid this unwanted behaviour at runtime
2)Function arguments
3)Cann't enforce structure of an object, No concept of template, Object are loosely structured
4)Application complexity
	
Why JavaScript
	Browsers support only JavaScript
	Browser & NodeJS environment cann't execute type script.

What is TypeScript
	A programming langugae
	Free & Open-source
	Developed & maintained by Microsoft
	TypeScript=JavaScript+Some additional feature(like types)
	TypeScript is superset of JavaScript.
	Makes building complex apps more manageable.
	Frameworks like Angular2+ is using it.
	A tool tsc
	
How TypeScript works
	During development time
		TypeScript can't be executed by JavaScript Environment like browsers.
		We can technically run the TypeScript compilation on browsers too. But it is very inefficient.
		TypeScript Code-->TypeScriptCompiler-->JavaScript code-->Browser/NodeJS environment
		
		How can TypeScript add new features if what you get in the end is regular JavaScript?
		And the answer is, the TypeScript compiler compiles these new features to JavaScript workarounds, 
		so in the end it might give you a nicer syntax, an easier way of doing something, and it will then compile that nicer, easier way
		to a more complex JavaScript snippet, which you would have to write otherwise.
		So it's not magic, of course it can't add what's not possible at all in the JavaScript language,
		but it can add new features that simply are easier to use, nicer syntax.

	
TypeScript Advantages
	Types 
		More types
		JavaScript uses dynamically type(resolved at runtime) while Typescript uses Static type(resolved at development time).
			Strong type checking in TS.It is type safe
	Next-gen JavaScript features(like Bable do)(Compiled down for older browser )
	Non-JavaScript features  OOPs (Interfaces or Generices during development)
	Meta-programming features like Decorators
	Rich configuration options
	Modern tooling(like Visual Studeo Code) that helps even in non-TypeScript projects
	Typescript is simpler than javascript coding
	

Ex:
Using JavaScript-
		const button = document.querySelector("button");
		const input1 = document.getElementById("num1");
		const input2 = document.getElementById("num2");
		function add(num1, num2) {
		  return num1 + num2;
		}
		button.addEventListener("click", function() {
		  console.log(add(input1.value, input2.value));
		});

Using TypeScript:
		const button = document.querySelector("button");
		const input1 = document.getElementById("num1")! as HTMLInputElement;
		const input2 = document.getElementById("num2")! as HTMLInputElement;
		function add(num1: number, num2: number) {
		  return num1 + num2;
		}
		button.addEventListener("click", function() {
		  console.log(add(+input1.value, +input2.value));  //+ here to convert String to number
		});



TypeScript
	TypeScript=JavaScript+Strong Typing
	
ECMAScrpt vs Javascript
	ECMAScrpt  is standard.
	Javascript is implementation
	
JavaScript History
	JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.
	ECMAScript is the official name of the language.
	ECMAScript versions have been abbreviated to ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5, and ES6.
	Since 2016, versions are named by year (ECMAScript 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020).
	
	The Original JavaScript ES1 ES2 ES3 (1997-1999)
	The First Main Revision ES5 (2009)
	The Second Revision ES6 (2015)
	Yearly Additions (2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020)
	
	Versions	Official Name	
	ES1	ECMAScript 1 (1997)
	ES2	ECMAScript 2 (1998)
	ES3	ECMAScript 3 (1999)
	ES4	ECMAScript 4	(Never released)
	ES5	ECMAScript 5 (2009)
	ES6  ECMAScript 2015
			ECMAScript 2016
			ECMAScript 2017
			ECMAScript 2018
			ECMAScript 2019
			ECMAScript 2020

	Modernn JavaScript(ES6+) helps us to write modularized, maintainable code.
	
	
Basics of TypeScript
	Typescript is case sensitive
	Angular packages are implemented  using typescript.
	Typescript supports datatypes/ oops/ namespaces,....
	Typescript file extension is .ts
	Every statement we should terminate with ; or new line
	tsc is a command to compile typescript program
	tsc filename.ts
	
Compiler: 
	is an umbrella term to describe a program that takes source code written in one language and produce a (or many) output file in some other language. 
	In practice we mostly use this term to describe a compiler such as gcc which takes in C code as input and produces a binary executable (machine code) as output.

Transpilers 
	are also known as source-to-source compilers. So in essence they are a subset of compilers which take in a source code file and convert it to another source code file in some other language or a different version of the same language. 
	The ouput is generally understandable by a human. This output still has to go through a compiler or interpreter to be able to run on the machine.
	Some examples of transpilers:
		Emscripten: Transpiles C/C++ to JavaScript
		Babel: Transpiles ES6+ code to ES5 (ES6 and ES5 are different versions or generations of the JavaScript language)
	transpiling
		to convert TypeScript code to JavaScript code
		"Transpiling" is accomplished with the tsc command
		
Run the code
	• To run the JavaScript code, we use the node command
	• Run the generated JavaScript code (.js file)
	C:\> node mydemo.js
	Hello World!


The Compiler is Your Friend
• The compiler / IDE can find errors earlier at compilation time


console.log, alert, confirm, prompt
	console.log("Hello");
	alert("Hello");
	confirm("Do you really want to do this?");
	var data = prompt("Please enter you name");
		console.log(data);
	var data = prompt("Enter a number");
	let num:number = parseInt(data);
	
	
	
	
	
	
What is TypeScript?
• Language developed by Microsoft in 2012
• Free and open-source
• Provides static typing support to JavaScript
• Helps with IDE support: code completion and debugging
• Add support for object-oriented programming
• Classes, objects, inheritance, interfaces, etc …
